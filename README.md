# Flappy-Bird-Clone
This is a simple flappy bird clone, which was more complex to program than I had expected. I used an entity system here, but what made it more complex was needing pairs of pipes, one up and the other down. And deleting them also posed new challenges. But this was very fun, and I was glad to simulate physics with acceleration once again.
